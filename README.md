# Samastham Connect Website

React + TypeScript single-page site for Samastham Connect, showcasing the health care agent platform for doctors and patients. The theme mirrors the mobile app palette and branding.

## Scripts

- `npm install` – install dependencies
- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server on port 5173
- `npm run build` – production build to `dist/`
